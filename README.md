# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe: Board-Game
Ultimate tic-tac-toe, also known as (tic-tac-toe)², is an advanced version of the classic board game. It consists of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a larger 3 × 3 grid. Players alternate turns on the smaller boards in an attempt to win the game on the larger grid. This version introduces a higher level of strategic complexity and presents a greater challenge to both human players and computers compared to the traditional tic-tac-toe.

# Rules of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe: 
## Game Start: 
Two players, X and O, participate. The first move can be made in any of the 81 empty spaces across the nine small boards. 
## Sequence of Play: 
After X's initial move, players alternate turns. The location chosen in the previous move dictates the small board where the next player must make their move. For instance, if X places a mark in the top right square of any small board, O must then play in the top right small board of the larger grid. The chosen spot within this small board will determine where the next player will play, and so on. 
## Winning a Small Board: 
A player wins a small board by aligning three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal, following standard tic-tac-toe rules. Winning a small board marks it as a victory for the winning player on the larger grid. 
## Move Restrictions: 
Once a small board is won or completely filled, it becomes out of bounds for further moves. If a player is directed to play in a board that is already won or filled, they may choose any other small board for their move. 
## Conclusion of the Game: 
The game concludes when a player wins the larger board by securing three small boards in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or if all boards are filled, resulting in no legal moves left, which leads to a draw.
